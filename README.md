## Overall aim

This course is an introduction to programming in R, including the basics of the R language, the facilities and practices necessary to produce useful scripts and to generate attractive outputs.

## Target audience
This course is for IEU reseachers with little or no experience in the R statistical software package but who need to use R for data analysis.

## Objectives
By the end of the course students will be able to:

Day 1
1.	Access the R website, download and install R
2.	Implement the basic operations of R
3.	Use R script files to organise R commands
4.	Make scripts ‘work’
5.	Manage large datasets
6.	Generate attractive outputs

Day 2 
1. Manage projects using RStudio
2. Identify and fix errors in scripts 
3. Write scripts that run efficiently and use multiple cores
4. Understand and write scripts that use tidyverse functions and data structures
